excercises

1. create DEPT table with the following columns
   DEPTNO number(4) - primary key, id of a department
   DNAME  varchar2(60)
   and, by using INSERT...SELECT, insert into this table all rows (but only appropriate columns) from DEPARTMENTS table

  CREATE TABLE dept (deptno number(3) primary key,
                     dname varchar2(60));

  INSERT INTO dept (deptno, dname)
  SELECT department_id, department_name 
  FROM departments;


2. create EMP table with the following columns
   EMPNO NUMBER(10) - primary key (id of an employee)
   NAME VARCHAR2(100) - not null (employee's last and first names)
   SAL  NUMBER(7,2) - salary
   DEPTNO NUMBER(4) - number of department, where the employee works, foreign key pointing to DEPT(DEPTNO) column


  CREATE TABLE emp (empno number(10) primary key,
                    name varchar2(100) not null,
                    sal number(7,2),
                    deptno number (4) references dept(deptno));


3. using INSERT...SELECT insert into this table all rows (but only appropriate columns) from EMPLOYEES table. For NAME column concatenate last_name, space and first_name 
   reminder: concatenation operator: ||

  INSERT INTO emp (empno, name, sal, deptno)
  SELECT employee_id, concat(concat(last_name,' '),first_name) as name, salary, department_id 
  FROM employees


4. create view EMP_SAL_STATS, which contains id of the department, its name, average, maximum and minimum of salary of all employees working in this department.
   Use DEPT and EMP tables as the source.

CREATE VIEW emp_sal_stats(department_id, department_name, avg_salary, max_salary, min_salary)
AS
SELECT d.department_id, d.department_name, AVG(e.salary), MAX(e.salary), MIN(e.salary)
FROM departments d, employees e
WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY (d.department_id, d.department_name)


Homework   

1. create view dep_sal_stats, which contains department_id, department_name and average salary for all employees working in such department
   please, try to insert a row into this view. What is the result of this insert command ?

CREATE VIEW dep_sal_stats(department_id, department_name, avg_salary)
AS
SELECT d.department_id, d.department_name, AVG(e.salary)
FROM departments d, employees e
WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY (d.department_id, d.department_name)

INSERT INTO dep_sal_stats(department_id, department_name, avg_salary)
VALUES (20,'Purchasing', 5000)


2. create a table dept_job_stats with the following structure:
    department_id number(3)
    department_name varchar2(30),
    job_id varchar2(30)
    salary number(10,2)

  CREATE TABLE dept_job_stats (department_id number(3),
                               department_name varchar2(30),
                               job_id varchar(30),
                               salary number(10,2));
    
3. please try to insert into the table created in exercise 2 rows containing appropriate information read from departments and employees table
   (try to use insert...select statement)

  INSERT INTO dept_job_stats (department_id,department_name,job_id,salary)
  SELECT d.department_id, d.department_name, e.job_id, e.salary
  FROM departments d, employees e
  WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id AND (e.employee_id = 100 OR e.employee_id = 101);
